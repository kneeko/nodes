-- how would this work? hmmm
-- i want a mesh to manager drawing this
-- but if i want to manipulate the colors tec
-- this can handle setting the vertices in the mesh

-- triangles would have a reference to their parent mesh
-- to change their vertices

-- when is the mesh created? how does a tile gain a reference to it?
-- maybe the graph contains the mesh, under the name 'map'

Triangle = class{
	
}
