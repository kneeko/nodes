how do I avoid coupling the viewport to the object renderer?
is it really such a big problem?





features:
- projection should happen in update, not draw
- generic asset management
	- generic weighted selection
	- audio as well as graphics
- font manager
	- handles dpi scaling and drawing
	- width/height computation memoization
	- approximate sizes (average char width)
- touch inputs borrowed in part from joystick prototype
- input manager
	- easy keymapping
	- hitbox based region culling
- automagic sprite batching
- generic FSM system (with transitions?)
- collision
	- detection
		- difference types (rect, poly, circ)
	- listeners
		- used to make 
		- layers, types, labels
	- intersection resolution
		- messaging system
		- physics?
- camera controller
	- follow objects
	- easing momentum
	- boundry
- touch input
	- define input and output sources
		- two fingers pan -> pass to movement controller
		- one finger -> pass to drawing controller
		- pinch zoom -> pass to camera controller
- object registration using signals?
